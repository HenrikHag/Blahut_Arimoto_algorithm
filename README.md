# Blahut Arimoto algorithm

An implementation in Python3 of the standard convex optimization technique by Arimoto and Blahut.  
The script is intended to approximate the channel capacity `C` given a stationary transition probability distribution `trans_prob_distr` as a two dimensional array, `n x m` matrix.  

---
# To run:
Change the transition probability distribution and increase `number_of_iterations` to achieve satisfactory accuracy.
